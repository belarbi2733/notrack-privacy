## üí¨ What is this?
notrack-privacy is a project that used an open source solution called Squid as proxy.

The idea is to use Firefox as browser and use the extension Firefox container.

You can create a new container called GAFAM. When you open one of this website, they will be opened in the GAFAM container but we will a proxy so they will not have the real ip adresse.

We will our proxy server using docker. The proxy will be used within username and password.

## üí™ Quickstart

To get started all you need to do is clone the repository and spin up the containers.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/belarbi2733/notrack-privacy
```
```bash
cd notrack-privacy
```
### Create user and password to access to our proxy

We need to install `apache2-utils` to use `htpassword` to generate a new password

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install apache2-utils -y
```
If this is the first time you create a user
```bash
htpassword -c conf/passwords user
#You will then asked for password
```
If you want to add more users
```bash
htpassword -b conf/passwords user
#You will then asked for password
```
After that you can start the docker service
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
### How to use ?
